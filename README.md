## Louis Vuitton Stock Level Check

Instead of sitting in front of your browser pressing F5 now and then to see if a particular item is in stock or not. It is now much easier to use this app to periodically check for you. If items are avaialble, it would notify you via SMS.

The app consists of 2 components:

* stock check poller
* notifier

The `stock check poller` would check for the stock availability of speific SKU(s) then notify users via SMS or Email via the `notifier` app

## Setup

`./bin/setup.sh`

Set environment variables, see Configuration section

To run:

`foreman start`
